If you want to set some authentication system like jwt, then you have to store your token inside client(browser). You store them either in localStorage or as a cookie. But when you perform any kind of server side operation, then you don't have access to the client. So you don't have access the cookies from server side. Then what is the solution?

### The solution.
```typescript
import { GetServerSideProps } from 'next'

export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps = async (ctx) => {
	const { req, res } = ctx

  	const {cookies} = req
	
	return { props: {  } }
}
```

I have created a YouTube video about this. You can check that out. If you like this video, please like and subscribe to my channel.

You can access the cookies from request object inside `getServerSideProps` data fetching method. You can learn about data fetching methods of nextjs from here

`getServerSideProps` method takes context as a parameter. Context is a giant object. Request and Response object is inside the context object.

```typescript
const { req, res } = ctx
```

In the `request` object you'll find a `cookies` object.

```typescript
const { cookies } = req
```

All your cookies will be inside `cookies` object.

So that's it. If you have any question, put them on the comment section. And also you can connect to me on any social media as @thatanjan.
